# Raylib-CPP-Project
Raylib C++ Project based on template by @educ8s at <a href="https://github.com/educ8s/Raylib-CPP-Starter-Template-for-VSCODE-V2?tab=readme-ov-file">this link</a>.  Mostly just trying to see what I can learn of Raylib, but may expand it if I come up with a more concise idea for it.

# How to use this template
1. Double click on the main.code-workspace file. This will open the template in VS Code.
2. From the Explorer Window of VS Code navigate to the src folder and double click on the main.cpp file.
3. Press F5 on the keyboard to compile and run the program.
